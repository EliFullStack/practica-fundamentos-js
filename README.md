# Classroom management
We need to develop an application made with javascript that helps us to manage the students in our class.
We will start with an initial list of students, and a number of supporting utilities in the exercises.
Each requirement has a number assigned to it. When we run the application, the complete list of requirements will appear. The user must click on the number corresponding to that requirement for it to be executed. Once the execution is finished, we will show the list of requirements again so that the user can select another one. In case the user presses 0 or a number not contemplated, the application will terminate.
## Considerations
  - The application must run under the Node.js environment, NOT in the browser.
  - For the practice to be considered OK, ALL essential requirements must work correctly.
  - It is important that each requirement is responsive to what is needed. That is, if a requirement asks for the number of students that meet a condition, the result must be just a number, and not the list of students that meet that condition. If this happens, it will be considered as an incorrect answer.
